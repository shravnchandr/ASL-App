```

### Option 2: Impact-Focused

```
🤟 Making ASL more accessible, one translation at a time.

I just launched ASL Dictionary - a free web app that translates English phrases into detailed American Sign Language descriptions using AI.

Why this matters:
• Over 500,000 people in the US use ASL as their primary language
• Learning ASL can be challenging without proper resources
• Many online tools lack detailed sign descriptions
• Accessibility in tech should be the standard, not an exception

What makes this different:
🔹 AI-powered detailed descriptions (not just videos)
🔹 Includes hand shapes, locations, movements, and facial expressions
🔹 Export translations to PDF for offline use
🔹 Redis caching for lightning-fast repeat translations
🔹 Admin dashboard for managing user feedback
🔹 Free to use with your own Google Gemini API key
🔹 Built with accessibility as a core principle (WCAG AAA compliant)
🔹 Dark mode, high contrast, keyboard navigation

This is just the beginning. I'm looking for feedback from:
• ASL learners and teachers
• Deaf and Hard of Hearing community members
• Accessibility advocates
• Fellow developers interested in inclusive tech

Title: Built an ASL Dictionary with React, FastAPI, and Google Gemini AI - Looking for feedback!

Hey r/webdev! 👋

I just finished building and deploying an ASL (American Sign Language) Dictionary web app and would love your feedback on the tech stack and implementation.

**What it does:**
Translates English phrases into detailed ASL sign descriptions using Google Gemini AI. Instead of just showing videos, it breaks down each sign with hand shapes, movements, locations, and facial expressions.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, jsPDF for PDF export
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.11+), async SQLAlchemy, pytest
- **AI:** Google Gemini 2.0 with LangGraph for workflow orchestration
- **Design:** Material 3 Expressive with custom Ocean Blue/Teal theme
- **Deployment:** Docker + Render.com with auto-deploy via render.yaml
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with asyncpg driver (SQLite for local dev)
- **Caching:** Redis for performance optimization

**Key Features:**
- WCAG AAA accessibility compliance
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- Rate limiting with SlowAPI
- Production optimizations (Terser, code splitting, ~260KB gzipped)
- PR preview environments
- Full TypeScript type safety
- Dark mode + high contrast themes
- PDF export with jsPDF
- Redis caching for performance
- Admin dashboard with analytics
- Comprehensive pytest test suite (13 passing tests)

**Performance:**
- Initial load: ~260KB gzipped
- Lighthouse score: 90+
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Redis caching for instant repeat translations

**What I'd love feedback on:**
1. Any security concerns I might have missed?
2. Suggestions for performance improvements?
3. Better error handling patterns for the AI integration?
4. UX improvements for the translation flow?

**Links:**
- Live app: [YOUR_RENDER_URL]
- GitHub: https://github.com/shravnchandr/ASL-App (MIT License)
- Full documentation in the repo

The entire codebase is open source, so feel free to check it out and suggest improvements. Happy to answer any technical questions!

**Update:** Special thanks to the community for helping me get this production-ready. All feedback is welcome!

Title: Made a free ASL Dictionary web app - looking for feedback from the community

Hi everyone! 👋🤟

I'm a developer who wanted to create a tool to help people learn ASL, and I'd really appreciate feedback from the community to make sure it's actually useful.

**What it is:**
ASL Dictionary - a free web app that translates English phrases into detailed ASL sign descriptions. It uses AI (Google Gemini) to break down signs into:
- Hand shapes and configurations
- Movement patterns and directions
- Location and orientation
- Facial expressions and non-manual markers

**Why I built it:**
I found that many ASL learning tools focus on videos, but sometimes you need to understand the *mechanics* of a sign - especially when learning or teaching. This tool provides detailed text descriptions to complement video resources.

**Important notes:**
- This is NOT meant to replace human ASL instruction or the Deaf community's expertise
- It's a supplementary learning tool for written descriptions
- I'm not Deaf or Hard of Hearing, so I really need community feedback
- 100% free to use - no ads, no data collection

**Features:**
- Detailed sign breakdowns
- Search history & favorites
- PDF export for offline use
- Print-friendly for classroom use
- Screen reader accessible
- Dark mode and high contrast options
- Works on mobile
- Fast repeat translations with Redis caching

**What I need from you:**
1. Is this tool actually useful? Be honest!
2. Are the descriptions accurate and helpful?
3. What features would make it more valuable?
4. Any concerns about how it's presented?
5. Should anything be changed or clarified?

**Try it:** [YOUR_RENDER_URL]

I want to make sure this tool respects and serves the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community. If there's anything that needs to be changed or if this isn't the right approach, please let me know. Your feedback is invaluable!

Thank you! 🤟

### For r/SideProject

```
Title: ASL Dictionary - My first production web app with React + FastAPI + AI [Open Source]

Hey r/SideProject!

Just finished my first real production-ready web app and wanted to share!

**Project:** ASL Dictionary
**Link:** [YOUR_RENDER_URL]
**GitHub:** https://github.com/shravnchandr/ASL-App

**What it does:**
Translates English phrases into detailed American Sign Language descriptions using Google Gemini AI. Think "Google Translate for ASL" but with detailed breakdowns of hand shapes, movements, and facial expressions.

**Why I built it:**
Started as a learning project to understand:
- React with TypeScript
- Python async/await with FastAPI
- AI integration with LangGraph
- Production deployment workflows

Ended up being something that might actually help people learn ASL!

**Tech Stack:**
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- FastAPI + Python 3.11 + pytest
- PostgreSQL + Redis caching
- Google Gemini AI
- Material 3 Design
- Docker + Render.com

**What I learned:**
1. Production is VERY different from development
2. Accessibility is hard but important
3. Security headers matter
4. Docker multi-stage builds are awesome
5. AI APIs can be unpredictable

**Challenges I faced:**
- Getting static files to serve correctly in production (spent hours on this!)
- Implementing proper rate limiting
- Making it accessible (WCAG AAA is no joke)
- Balancing AI responses with user expectations

**Stats:**
- ~4 weeks of development
- 260KB bundle size (gzipped)
- 13 passing backend tests
- 100% open source
- $0 hosting cost (Render free tier + optional Redis)

**What's next:**
Looking for feedback and feature suggestions! Recently added:
- ✅ PDF export functionality
- ✅ Redis caching for performance
- ✅ Admin dashboard for analytics
- ✅ PostgreSQL production database

Future ideas:
- Video integration
- Practice mode
- Mobile app

Would love to hear what you think! Also happy to answer any technical questions about the stack or deployment process.

**Note:** I'm not an ASL expert, so feedback from the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community is especially welcome to make sure this is actually useful and respectful.
